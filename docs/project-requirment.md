# NLP Course Project: Sentiment Analysis

## Project Title

**Sentiment Analysis of Users Regarding Banking Services (or Any Desired Service) on Social Media Networks**

## Objective

Extract and analyze sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from user comments about banking services (or any similar industry) to help improve customer experience.

## Project Phases

### 1. Data Collection

**Options:**

- Use APIs from Twitter, Telegram, website comments, or existing datasets
  - Examples: 140Sentiment dataset, Bank Customer Reviews Dataset
- Create a manual dataset with 1,000 real user comments

**Important Notes:**

- You can use ready-made datasets OR collect your own data
- Data can be about any desired topic from any social media platform
- **Minimum requirement:** 100 comments
- **Bonus points:** Collecting data yourself earns special credit

### 2. Text Preprocessing

**Required steps:**

- **Noise removal:** URLs, emojis, tags/mentions
- **Tokenization**
- **Stemming or Lemmatization**
- **Stop words removal**
- **Normalization:** lowercasing, spelling error correction

### 3. Text Representation

**Use different methods:**

- **TF-IDF**
- **Word Embedding** (e.g., Word2Vec)

### 4. Modeling (Sentiment Classification)

**Classic models:**

- Logistic Regression

**Advanced models:**

- Simple neural networks (CNN/LSTM)
- **Transformer models** like BERT
- **Bonus points:** Fine-tuning transformer models earns special credit

### 5. Model Evaluation

**Required metrics:**

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

**Additional analysis:**

- Error analysis and examples of model's incorrect predictions

### 6. Final Analysis and Report

**Deliverables:**

- Overall sentiment analysis for each bank or specific service categories
  - Examples: online services, employees, branch offices
- Charts and insights from data analysis

## Technical Requirements

**Programming Language:** Python

**Recommended Libraries:**

- nltk
- sklearn
- transformers
- pandas
- keras or pytorch

## Bonus Points

- **Working with Persian/Farsi data** earns special credit
- **Self-collected datasets** earn special credit
- **Fine-tuning transformer models** earns special credit

## Important Notes

- Different methods and models in phases 3 and 4 will produce different results
- **All approaches must be compared** at the end of the project
- Choose your methods strategically to demonstrate comprehensive understanding

## Expected Outcomes

- Functional sentiment analysis system
- Comparative analysis of different approaches
- Actionable insights for improving customer experience
- Well-documented methodology and results
